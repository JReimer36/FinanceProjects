# FinanceProjects
Various projects related to trying to integrate analytics to automate or illustrate financial data
## First two focused on creating an optimally balanced portfolio by sharpe ratio and testing performance against the S&P 500
### V2 uses first half of data to create portfolio, then tests on second half
### V3 continually rebalances according to user preference (Second visual is not working on GitHub upload, from an unused package)
